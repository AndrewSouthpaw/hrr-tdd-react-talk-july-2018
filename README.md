# react-tdd

Test Driven Development (TDD) is widely regarded as an effective and scalable approach to software design, but its adoption has stagnated in React. Writing useful frontend tests for real-world codebases turns out to be quite hard.

There's a two-fold purpose for `react-tdd`:

1. Provide useful helper functions to facilitate writing better and more useful React tests, and
1. Provide a source of education through articles and examples that tackle the kinds of real-world testing problems that usually stymie developers.

# Helper Functions

Available as a package under `react-tdd`.

# Education

Link to and discuss articles in `articles.md` and find examples of React tests organized under the `examples` folder.
