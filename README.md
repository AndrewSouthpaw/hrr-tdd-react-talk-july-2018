# react-tdd

React testing utilities and education about React TDD.

Test Driven Development (TDD) is widely regarded as an effective and scalable approach to software design, but its adoption has stagnated in React. Writing useful frontend tests for real-world codebases turns out to be quite hard.

There's a two-fold purpose for `react-tdd`:

1. Provide useful helper functions to facilitate writing better and more useful React tests, and
1. Provide a source of education through articles and examples that tackle the kinds of real-world testing problems that usually stymie developers.

# Helper Functions

`react-tdd` packages a collection of [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) helper functions that allow developers to write more declarative React tests.

Install: `yarn add -D react-tdd`

Usage: until some docs are written, just check out the comments in the source code!

# Education

Link to and discuss articles in `articles.md` and find examples of React tests organized under the `examples` folder.
